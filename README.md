# Pinax Chains

Welcome to the Pinax Chains repository. This is the definitive source for the metadata of chains supported by Pinax **_products_**. Note that we maintain a separate, private list for internal operations.

To enhance accessibility, we offer the metadata as an [npm package](#install_from_npm) and provide a [public API endpoint](#public_endpoint) for fetching the data.

You can view details about the [Chain Type](/types/chain.types.ts) and explore our [list of supported, to-be-supported, or deprecated chains](/types/pinax.types.ts).

> **Note**: Some chains may be listed without supported services or may have been deprecated. Always check the chain's metadata to confirm its current support status.
