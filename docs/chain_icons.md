# Chain Icons

For our chain icons, we use [Edge & Node's Token Icons library](https://tokenicons.io/). The library is a collection of SVG icons for various blockchain tokens and chains. The library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xa3k5/token-icons), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@token-icons/react) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1355517329090639687/token-icons-community).

In this repository, we leverage the library's metadata (in the final data.json generation script), to make sure that the chain icons are up-to-date with the latest changes. See [data_json.js](../scripts/generate/data_json.js) for more information.
