# Beta Chains

Beta chains are chains that are not yet officially supported by Pinax. These chains are not yet available in the Pinax UI, but endpoints are available for developers to use. These chains are typically requested to use by The Graph and while we do not productize them, we support them and they _**should**_ have the stability required by our contract with The Graph.

We assume those are still risky to use on a production app.
